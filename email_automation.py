Hello Dr. {family_nameName},

I hope you are fine.
I am writing to apply for the Ph.D. position in the areas of cyber security combining with software engineering and AI.

As I reviewed your research works regarding cybersecurity, I found them perfectly close to my research interests. Therefore, I would like to ask you kindly to consider me as a candidate for the master or Ph.D. position working under your supervision for 2022. The following paragraph is summary of my CV.

I am a bachelorâ€™s degree graduated of electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology (top 3 university in Iran). I have won the first prize in an international competition, named Huawei ICT Skill, in 2017. I have trained in Huawei HQ and Huawei University in Shenzhen, China. Besides, I was accepted at Padua University for fall 2020 in MS Cybersecurity, but unfortunately my visa was rejected. Moreover, I have one year of versatile professional work experience in R&D cybersecurity development engineer. In specific, researching on SIEM tools, threat intelligence, and historical event correlation, and etc. To sum up, I love researching on innovative security projects such as deep learning, machine learning, malware detection, incident handling, an etc. 
Full details of my skills are available in the enclosed CV.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Arastoo Zibaeirad
