    This rule identifies Zoom meetings that are created without a passcode. Meetings without a passcode are susceptible to
    Zoombombing. Zoombombing is carried out by taking advantage of Zoom sessions that are not protected with a passcode.
    Zoombombing refers to the unwanted, disruptive intrusion, generally by Internet trolls and hackers, into a video
    conference call. In a typical Zoombombing incident, a teleconferencing session is hijacked by the insertion of material
    that is lewd, obscene, racist, or antisemitic in nature, typically resulting of the shutdown of the session."""
